Experiment to enable vim being invoked as a script interpreter, even when the vimscript block in question is used within a  unix pipe.

This is basically my take on the original vimscript#1069 vimsh from 2004,  sufficiently mangled until it finally did mostly work again with unix pipes and using vim 7.2 (excluding the g//p issue, where the prints  get replicated all over the place - drop me a line if you have an idea). 

Note that vim still does some unnecessary screen redrawing if it is connected to a  tty, however I
actually  managed  to run a vimscript even from a cronjob, much to  my surprise.

Further information and example vimscript blocks: see --help.

I'll intend to keep this somewhat uptodate, at least until vim can be run non-interactively without the requirements for such a hack.
